# Analysis

## Layer 4, Head 10

I have appreciated a strong relationship among (under,my,feet), 
and also in the construct ([verb],the,[MASK],grass).

It is also worth noting that the top suggestions for verb 'feel' were 'soft','wet','dry' and
for 'see' we got 'tall','soft','green', so this attention from the verb vs. the object, including the [MASK], seems so evident.

Example Sentences:
- I see the [MASK] grass under my feet.
- I feel the [MASK] grass under my feet.

## Layer 8, Head 11

There is a noticeable relationship between the demonstrative and the noun inside the object of the sentence (this/weather, damn/summer), with or without an adjective in between. 

It's also worth noting the relation (I/[MASK]/this) in the first sentence and ([MASK]/enjoyed) in the second one.

Example Sentences:
- I [MASK] this damn weather.
- We [MASK] enjoyed that summer.
